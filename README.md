🚀 Alien Invasion — Learning Project
This project is based on the Python Crash Course (3rd Edition) book.
I typed the code myself while following the chapters and used it as a learning exercise to understand:

- Pygame fundamentals

- Event loops

- Sprite groups

- Keyboard handling

- Class-based game architecture

I may have missed 1–2 docstrings or comments compared to the book, but the overall logic and structure match the tutorial.
